This is Rides Data Analysis of "Ride IT" which is a multi-service mobility company that implements smart transportation solutions. RIDE IT also offers micro-mobility services such as e-scooters, e-bikes, e-Vespas as well as car sharing all under the same app. 


This dataset is given by my mentor cosists real data of Ride IT drivers. My task is to find drivers engagement, behaviour, interaction and metrics which I have using Tableau.

Key insights:

~ I have observed that the offers or rides in the starting day of every month is comparatively high and making more riders available on this day helps improvement.

~There are some riders whose bookings are being cancelled frequently, so I highlighted them. This helps finding problems of passenger with these particualar riders.
